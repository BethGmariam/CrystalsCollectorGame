# Crystals Collector Game (memory game).
*unit-4-game 

# How the app works:

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game (between 19 - 120).
Each crystal have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
When the game begins again, the player sees a new random number.
The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. 
The game restarts without refreshing the page.
